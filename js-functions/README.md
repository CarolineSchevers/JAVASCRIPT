## Exercise

We are going to make a calculator! The basic setup you can find in [this](./index.html) HTML file. This calculator needs to have some basic functionality like any other calculator:

- [ ] Enter a number by clicking buttons `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, ....
- [ ] Choose a basic operation `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
- [ ] Display the result of the calculation `=`.
- [ ] Clear any entries `C`.

Additionally, the buttons need to have a hover effect! But because we are learning events and not CSS, we are not going to use `button:hover`. Instead, we are going to use the class `.hovering`. We are going to add this class to and remove it from the buttons through the use of events!

Lastly, you need to make the calculator accept keyboard input by means of key events! 

Good luck!
