## Exercise

### Variables

1. Start by making an `index.html` file. Anything that is asked from you should be done inside this document.
1. Next, look up what variables are.
1. Define a variable using at least these methods:
    * `let`
    * `var`
    * `const`
1. Log the variables you just created to the console using `console.log()` and `console.dir()`.
1. Make sure you understand what the difference is between these variables and explain it in your document (comments FTW).

### Data types

1. Look up what data types are and which ones exist.
1. Make some variables for each data type and log them to the console.
1. Make sure you understand what the difference is between these data types and explain it in your document (comments FTW - AGAIN).

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to show the data types we'll be using for the moment!</strong></summary>

* number
* string
* boolean
* array
</details>  



### Operators

1. Google what operators are and which different kind of operators exist.
1. Lookup what the operators below do and how they can be used.
1. Make sure you understand what the difference is between these operators and explain it in your document (comments).

<details>
<summary><strong>List of arithmetic operators: </strong></summary>

* `+`
* `-`
* `*`
* `/`
* `%`
* `++`
* `--`
</details>  

<details>
<summary><strong>List of assignment operators: </strong></summary>

* `+=`
* `-=`
* `*=`
* `/=`
* the rest you can look up online...
</details>  

### Data types and operators!

1. Combine all of the datatypes with all of the operators and see what happens!
1. Make an HTML table listing all of the different results


## Goals

After this chapter, you should have acquired the following skills/competencies:

- [ ] Understand what variables are.
- [ ] Know the difference in datatypes as well as a basic understanding of what's out there.
- [ ] Combine datatypes with each other and know what the result will be.
- [ ] Understand what the different operators do and are generally used for.
