1. Add some `console.log`'s in the code and see what certain variables contain. Play around with it a little bit!
1. Determine where in the already-present script, we will have to write the code to determine the winner and the loser.
1. Now write the code to determine the winner and the loser.
1. Style your page to make it look a bit more appealing!
