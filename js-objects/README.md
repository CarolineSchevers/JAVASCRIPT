## Warm up
Before we dive into the world of objects, do some research for the keywords below. 

## Keywords
* JSON
* Constructor
* this. js
* new operator js
* Object methods
* Custom methods

## Challenge
Display all the object keys and values in a html file as a **list**.
Create a section for each exercise.

## Exercise 1
Tell us a little more about yourself in this exercise. Create an object named `'aboutMe'`. 


Create the following properties:
* Name
* Age
* Gender
* Favorite food
* Favorite series
* Favorite movies
* Single

Now Imagine we have to create objects for your whole family... That is a lot of work for such a small result.  
**Good news!** We don't have to do this!


## Exercise 2

Create a constructor named `"FamilyMember"`. By using this method, create 3 objects:
* Father
* Mother
* Brother/Sister


## Exercise 3
For this exercise, create a button for each family member. And display an image of the members.
Now let's create a method inside the constructor.
This should do the following:
* Register when the button has been pressed. (console.log)
* Toggle the displayed images on/off (one at a time!).


## Exercise 4
GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL! That's right our Pokémon app is back!
In our previous Pokémon exercise, we used pre-written variables.
Now with your JSON knowledge, transform these properties into an object named `pokémon`. 

In this object there should be 2 **methods** that will:

* Show only 2 random moves from the array.
* Display a small paragraph about the selected pokemon with the collected data. (Example: This is `Pikachu`. `Pikachu` uses `thunderbolt`, `iron-tail`  as moves and has a total weight of `60`.)

plus 6 **properties** : 

* Name
* Id
* Moves
* Abilities
* Image
* Weight


Make sure the app still works!

## Group exercise
Study as a group of four the project located in Example-exercise3.
**Clone this folder to your local repository**. Make notes in your README file and discuss what you think parts of the script do.

Write comments within the script where needed.


## Goals

- [ ] Understand how to create an object.
- [ ] Understand how to manipulate an object.
- [ ] Understand how to create an constructor.
