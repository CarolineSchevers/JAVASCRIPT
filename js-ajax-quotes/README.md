Also take a look at the keywords below.
Keywords

Exercise

    Publish a web page that shows a random quote from this web service: Thats the spirit
    You can find the web service here. This is called the end point.

    If the request to the web service fails, give an error message. If the request is successful, convert the JSON response to HTML and display it.

    Make your webpage look nice with the help of SCSS.

Bonus

Create a button that will load the data from the api. (Instead of pressing refresh constantly.)
