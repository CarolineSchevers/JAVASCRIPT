## Challenge 1

Our website needs a '`register user`' [form](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp), it will take `10` **required** inputs and `3` **optional** inputs.

**Required**:  
* Firstname
* Lastname
* Username
* Email address
* Password
* Confirm password
* Address
* City
* Zip
* Submit

**Optional** :

* Phone number
* Age
* Hobbies


#### Steps for this challenge:  
1. Do some research and have a look at how forms are build. (keywords)  
    * Required inputs
    * HTML fieldset
    * Form input
    * input type
    * Label type

1. Create an HTML page with all input fields included. (Styling is for later.)
1. Make sure you use the **labels** properly!


## Challenge 2
Okay, now we have our HTML with a form. But nothing happens when we click on the submit input.

Find a way to store the data on submitting inside of variables/an object.

## Challenge 3
Now that we have our data stored, we need to validate the user password. Do the passwords match?

Maybe its time to redirect the user, to a page that informs them about the successful registration?

## Challenge 4

As you may guess, our next step is to validate if the user input matches our 'needs'. What I mean by this is, for example, A password **must** contain at least 1 number & 1 uppercase.

Our requirements are:
* **Email** can only have '@gmail.com' other email providers are not allowed!
* **Password** must contain at least 1 number & 1 uppercase.

**Bonus:**  
Take a look at [regular expressions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_regexp.asp).

## Challenge 5

If the user fills in the form incorrectly, there should appear feedback that tells the user what went wrong.

**Requirements**: 
* Input border should turn red (only for the ones that are failing).
* An error message should tell the user what is required to succeed.
* All input fields should stay filled in except for the incorrect ones.

## Challenge 6

Now make the page beautiful with SCSS, in any theme you want!
