## Welcome adventurer, monster or whatever you are.
We are reaching the end of the JavaScript course, but no worries: it does not end here. There are so many things to discover, so many things to touch.
Don't let it scare you because it is so much fun in the end!

This "last" challenge will test your knowledge about JavaScript. If you're struggling, that's fine. Just don't forget to ask your colleagues for help!

## Who am I?
I am Becodiante The Great, a powerfull wizard in search of the strongest JavaScript gurus alive.


## Let...
me take a proper look at you... Aha, I see. You might be the right fit for this challenge! Though you will have to team up with someone.

## Before we begin...
I have given you a magical **script** that must be used to create your avatar!  
OH right... Your instructions. * Coughs *.   
You and your colleague have to program a game where you can battle each other. 
The players can use buttons to define which move he/she will make next.
The game shall only end when a player reaches 0 health.

Don't worry I shall guide you and help you on your way.

## The stats


<details><summary>Game example (It does not have to look like this!).</summary>

![](resources/Image1.jpg)
</details>

Each calculation should run for one attack. For instance, if I have a bow and decide to attack. I might get lucky and strike twice.
If the opponent wears boots, he could dodge the attack twice, once or never.


| ITEMS | Boots                                | Staff                  | Sword           | Bow                          |
|-------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
|       | 30% chance to dodge an attack        | 20% increase in healing| 30% more damage | 30% chance to attack twice   |

<br>

| RACE | Humans               | Orcs                    | Elves                                                         | Vampires                                           |
|------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|      |20% less damage taken |40% more max health      | 30% chance to reflect the attack back to the opponent. They take damage equal to 50% of the original hit. |10% lifesteal from opponents current health at start of the vampire's turn. |

**ATTENTION**  
In the `character.js` file, you can define what effects will take place on certain events.
If the player is an orc and if he/she has boots, the stats will take effect straight on creation.

I also expect you to randomize the healing and attack function. Feel free to edit the script to your likings. 

Each member of the team can select atleast one journey. Journey 1 will have more visual related challenges, journey 2 will have more gamelogic related challenges.  
Discuss who will take which path.

## Journey 1


<details><summary>Player1 starts here!</summary>   
<br>

**Challenge 1:**

Create an HTML page with the following elements included:

* A title.
* An element to display both characters stats (visual, name, item, health...) [Something like a VS screen](https://cmkt-image-prd.global.ssl.fastly.net/0.1.0/ps/2050964/910/607/m1/fpnw/wm0/sample8-.jpg?1482262310&s=b524ce6f06ee59486cfa7ffa7a78ad99)
* A panel with 6 buttons, 3 for each player (hit, heal & yield. Those are the moves.)
* A creation panel with inputs & dropdowns to create your character. (For now only name, items and race )
* A log that will tell you which move the player made.

**Challenge 2:**  

For this step do some research for the ES6 modules, this so you can use my character.js file.
Save the inputs inside variables/an object, and use them to initiate new characters for both players.

**Challenge 3:**

Make sure that only the title, VS screen and the input field are visible when creating the characters.

**Challenge 4**

When the characters are created, the creation panel should disappear. After this, the `move` & `log` panel should appear.

**Challenge 5**

Display the health bar of both players this should work real-time.
Make sure it has a decrease/increase animation
Make use of max-health and currentHealth.

## Journey 2

<details><summary>Player2 starts here!</summary>  
<br>

**Challenge 1:**

Create a js file named `gamelogic.js`. You are in charge of writing the game itself.
Take a look at the `character.js` file. Find a way to import the exported Module (constructor). (Take a look at `ES6 modules`)

**Note**: You will have to work with this file as well. Its up to you to find out what belongs where.

**Challenge 2:**

Initiate a temporary character. We will use this to test our game logic.

**Challenge 3:**

Write a function that will handle the races. This will only run once.

**Challenge 4:**

Write a function that will handle the items. This will be called everytime we make a move. 

**Challenge 5:**

Make the functions work with the character. See if the stats change on creation.

**Challenge 6:**

Lower the health of your object and create a healing function that will use the `heal` function. (character.js)
Make it so the function uses a random number between the minHealing and maxHealing.

**Note:** The `currentHealth` should **NEVER** go above the `maxHealth`

## The Boss

We are almost finished. There are still some things to tackle.

Here is a list of what the two of you should work out:

* Combine the code + html for some 'working result'.
* Inputs should generate the characters stats.
* Work out the attack function (Almost the same as heal but it has to hit the enemy).
* When a player loses, display a victory message & a loose message for each player.
* At the end of the game, you should be able to restart the game to create a new character.

## The final encounter

* Style this arena to your taste.
* Add extra functions. (Keep it appropriate.)
* Prepare to present your work.

<details><summary>Well done! Now challenge people!</summary>
